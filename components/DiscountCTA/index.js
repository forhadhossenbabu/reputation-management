            Many of our customers need multiple videos with multiple messages
            for different products, messages, or angles for testing. As a bonus,
            you get a 15% discount on the purchase of 3 (or more) videos. Just
            let us know after your purchase of the first video, and we will send
            a special link to apply the 15% to your total (Perfect if you need 1
            x testimonial/case study video, 1 x website video, and 1 x
            instagram/facebook video).
